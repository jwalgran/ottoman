== Ottoman

Ottoman is intended to be an easy to use open source library for .NET applications 
using CouchDB for persistence.  Please excuse the mess, this is a new project and 
we are trying to get everything in order.  We will be setting up a project site,
mailing list, and issue tracker.  This will be an active open source project and 
backed by a company.  We have big plans for this library.

== Building

To run the automated build tasks, you will need to have ruby installed on your local 
machine.  You can download the one click installer for windows from here:

	http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
	
After installation, make sure you grab the rake gem by running at a command prompt:

	gem install rake

Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine you're ready to run the automated 
build scripts.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory of your cloned 
repository (Hint:  The location of build.cmd).  Then you can run the build commands 
by typing without the quotes:

	To compile:  Type "build compile" or just "build" and hit enter.
	To test:  Type "build test" and hit enter
