== Ottoman

Ottoman is intended to be an easy to use open source library for .NET applications 
using CouchDB for persistence.  Please excuse the mess, this is a new project and 
we are trying to get everything in order.  We will be setting up a project site,
mailing list, and issue tracker.  This will be an active open source project and 
backed by a company.  We have big plans for this library.
